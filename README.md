# DeepMind Atari Deep Q Learner
This repository hosts the [original code](https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/) published along with [the article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html) in Nature and my experiments (if any) with it.

Disclaimer
----------
  * This codebase is not written by me (only the "+ my tweaks" part) and I am not employed by DeepMind.
  * This implementation is rather old and there are far more efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning available. If you are interested in applying RL to your problem have a look at [Keras-RL](https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl) or [rllab](https://github.com/openai/rllab) instead.

Dependencies
------------
These package names are valid for Ubuntu 14.04.
You should install them before running the `install_dependencies.sh` script.
* build-essential
* gcc
* g++
* cmake
* curl
* libreadline-dev
* git-core
* libjpeg-dev
* libpng-dev
* ncurses-dev

DQN 3.0

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with nVidia GTX 970:

This project contains the source code of DQN 3.0, a Lua-based deep reinforcement
learning architecture, necessary to reproduce the experiments
described in the paper "Human-level control through deep reinforcement
learning", Nature 518, 529–533 (26 February 2015) doi:10.1038/nature14236.

To replicate the experiment results, a number of dependencies need to be
installed, namely:
* LuaJIT and Torch 7.0
* nngraph
* Xitari (fork of the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013))
* AleWrap (a lua interface to Xitari)
An install script for these dependencies is provided.

Two run scripts are provided: run_cpu and run_gpu. As the names imply,
the former trains the DQN network using regular CPUs, while the latter uses
GPUs (CUDA), which typically results in a significant speed-up.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

The installation requires Linux with apt-get.

Note: In order to run the GPU version of DQN, you should additionally have the
NVIDIA® CUDA® (version 5.5 or later) toolkit installed prior to the Torch
installation below.
This can be downloaded from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
and installation instructions can be found in
http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux


To train DQN on Atari games, the following components must be installed:
* LuaJIT and Torch 7.0
* nngraph
* Xitari
* AleWrap

To install all of the above in a subdirectory called 'torch', it should be enough to run

    ./install_dependencies.sh

from the base directory of the package.


Note: The above install script will install the following packages via apt-get:
build-essential, gcc, g++, cmake, curl, libreadline-dev, git-core, libjpeg-dev,
libpng-dev, ncurses-dev, imagemagick, unzip

Training DQN on Atari games
---------------------------

Prior to running DQN on a game, you should copy its ROM in the 'roms' subdirectory.
It should then be sufficient to run the script

    ./run_cpu <game name>

Or, if GPU support is enabled,

    ./run_gpu <game name>


Note: On a system with more than one GPU, DQN training can be launched on a
specified GPU by setting the environment variable GPU_ID, e.g. by

    GPU_ID=2 ./run_gpu <game name>

If GPU_ID is not specified, the first available GPU (ID 0) will be used by default.

Storing a .gif for a trained network
------------------------------------

Once you have a snapshot of a network you can run

	./test_gpu <game name> <snapshopt filename>

to make it play one game and store the .gif under `gifs`. For example

	./test_gpu breakout DQN3_0_1_breakout_FULL_Y.t7

Options
-------

Options to DQN are set within run_cpu (respectively, run_gpu). You may,
for example, want to change the frequency at which information is output 
to stdout by setting 'prog_freq' to a different value.
